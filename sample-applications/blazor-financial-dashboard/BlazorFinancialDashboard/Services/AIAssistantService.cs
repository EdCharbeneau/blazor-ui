        new FAQ("How can I save money without changing my lifestyle?", "Saving money without changing your lifestyle is all about optimizing what you're already doing. Set up an automatic transfer from your checking to your savings account right after each paycheck. Use credit cards with cashback or rewards on purchases you already make. Audit your streaming, app, and service subscriptions. Cancel unused ones or switch to shared family plans. Move your savings to a high-yield online savings account to earn more interest passively."),
        new FAQ("What is the best way to build an emergency fund?", "The best way to build an emergency fund is to treat it like a non-negotiable monthly bill and grow it steadily with a clear goal in mind. Target 3 to 6 months of essential living expenses (housing, food, transportation, insurance, and minimum debt payments).")
